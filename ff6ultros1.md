## FINAL FANTASY VI - Ultros 1 race guide #


I've made this guide to bring more people into racing FFVI in SpeedrunsLive, it will cover until Ultros 1 who is approximatively ~45mn long. It's fun, not that hard and it will maybe give you the desire to do a full game run afterwards ;)  

You cannot use this for a full game run since I'm skipping items that you don't need for Ultros 1 but are absolutely necessary for a any%.  

This guide was made thanks to Essentia, MisterMV and gnuvince's notes. You can follow them on Twitch !

## 1. Narshe ##

- **Terra** back row

 **Config** :  
 
    Battle speed 6 
    Message Speed 1 
    Cursor Memory

**First Battle**

- **Terra** : bio blast  
- **Vicks and Wedge** : run away

    **Note** : Terra needs experience to get level 6 before leaving Narshe so Locke can benefit from Terra's level (Terra's Level + 2 levels), so she is using Bio Blast to let them get full ATB to make them flee after the end of the attack and the end of the battle. It happens that they won't escape no matter what though.

**Second battle**

- Avoid the second battle. Instead of going at the middle, avoid it by taking one step right, up,  then left.

**Third battle**

- **Vicks and Wedge** : Fire beam left guard and right lobo
- **Terra** : bio blast the right guard
- **Vicks and Wedge** : run away  

    **Note** : Vicks needs to kill the right guard so they would be able to escape, and the lobo acts as a boss so they cannot escape unless he dies.  

**Fourth battle**  

- **Vicks and Wedge** : Fire beam on Vomammoths
- **Terra** : bio blast
- **Vicks and Wedge** : run away  

    **Note** : Same thing for Vommamoths, they act as a boss so Vicks and Wedge cannot escape if they're alive.

##2. In the mine##

Get Terra's level 6 by fighting random battles along the way :  

- **Terra** : Use fire on everything
- **Vicks and Wedge** : run away  

    **Note** : This is actually a little tricky since the fire animation is faster than bio blast, don't forget that they need a full ATB to escape.  

#### Boss : Whelk (1600 HP) #
 The goal is to launch 2 Tek Missiles before going back to his shell, but this is only possible if Terra has more than a 50% charged ATB at the beginning, if it's not the case, do not try to launch a second Tek missile.

**In order** :  

- **Terra** : Tek Missile
- **Vicks and Wedge** : Bolt Beam x2
- **Terra** : Tek Missile  
    (Only if Terra had more than a 50% charged ATB at the beginning of the battle, otherwise, do not try it and wait until the next phase of the boss)
- Whelk goes into his shell, wait until he says "Gruuuuu..." a second time to hit the head.
- **Terra** : Tek Missile

----------

- Rename **Terra** "**T**"

## 3. Cave Pursuit
- If Terra still isn't level 6, get it here by using Fire in every battle before the next event.
- Rename **Locke** "**L**"
#### Boss : Marshall battle (420 HP)

Here is a easy skip but you need to be fast in order to get it. With this, you can avoid all the battles and get directly to the boss.


<iframe width="483" height="320" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/o7bta5ACa1Y?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


- You need to get Locke out of the way to let Mog walk, Locke down and then take a step to the right.
- Switch characters and take the same path as the videos (you can find other paths if you want), when the enemy is walking to the same height as you, go immediately to the right, wait for the last enemy to come up, and when he's walking near your position  

- Leave Narshe, run away from all the battles and enter Figaro


## 4. Figaro #
- Go to the throne room, meet Edgar and rename it to "E"
-  Go to the west wing of the castle and talk to the matron
-  Rename Sabin into "S", then go back to the throne room
- When in control of Edgar, talk to both guards then Kefka
- With Terra, go to the east wing and then talk to Locke
- When in control of Edgar, **DO NOT** talk to Kefka, talk directly to the guard up.
### Magitek Armor #
-  **Edgar** : Auto Crossbow x2
-  **Locke** : Steal
-  **Terra** : Defend  

    **Note** : **DO NOT** cast fire on them or it will trigger a very long cutscene.

## 5. Cave of South Figaro #
- With the chocobo, go to the cave to the east

* From there, your characters need to level up like this :
 - **Terra** : **level 8** (if you've done everything right, she only needs 2 levels)
 - **Locke** : **level 9** (+1 level)
 - **Edgar** : **level 10** (+2 level)

This way, Sabin will be level 11 (average +2) and Banon will be level 6 (average - 3), it's important because there is no way Banon could survive the Lete river without getting some levels. 

Beat enemies that comes in your travel with auto-crossbow but don't stay there for grind purpose, you'll get more experience at Mt.Koltz.

- After that, go to South Figaro
 
## 6. South Figaro #

- Buy 1 **sprints shoes**
- Equip it to Terra
- Edgar and Locke back row
- Buy a chocobo and ride it to Mt.Koltz

## 7. Mt.Koltz #
- Escape all battles until you get the **Atlas Armlet** in the secret passage  

![](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2013/31/1375244832-ff6gba-map08-mtkolts.png)

- Equip the relic to Edgar
- Level up as you go further in Mt.Koltz (Remember,  Edgar lv10, Locke lv9 and Terra lv8). 
-  Auto-crossbow should kill them all in one hit with Atlas Armlet (except Tuskers, you also need to use Fire on them).
- On the next savepoint, use a sleeping bag on Terra if she's short on MP   
(don't forget to cure before using a sleeping bag)
- Cure before Vargas if needed
#### Boss : Vargas #
* Against **Ipoohs** :
 - **Edgar**: Auto-crossbow  
 - **Locke** : Steal
 - **Terra** : Fire on both

----------

* Against **Vargas** :     
 - **Edgar **: Auto-crossbow                              
 - **Locke** : Fight          
 - **Terra** : Fire
- When with Sabin : use Pummel with Blitz (Left Right Left and confirm)  
    **Note** : If you've done things right, Sabin should now be level 11

- Runaway from all battles, leave Mt.Koltz and get to the Returner's Hideout

## 8. Returner's Hideout #
- Talk to Banon
- After Terra wakes up, you need to talk to Locke, Sabin and Edgar.
- Then, talk to Banon outside the hideout and say "NO" three times, if you don't, it will trigger a long cutscene.



##9. Lethe River #
**Note** : In the Lethe River, you can have between 2 and 8 battles, run from every battles.

- Get Sabin and Banon into back row
- Heal if needed
 
#![](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2013/31/1375246084-11-ultros.gif) ULTROS 1 (3 000 HP)

- **Banon** : Health in the first turn, then defend during all the battle (if you need to cure, use Terra instead)
- **Sabin** : Use aurabolt with Blitz (Down Left Left and confirm) five times
- **Edgar** : Use auto-crossbow five times
- **Terra** : Defend and deal the last hit with fire after Sabin and Edgar dealt all of their attacks (if you use Fire before, it will trigger a dialogue that will cost you sometime).
