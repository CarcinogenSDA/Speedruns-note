## Day 2
###NYPD :

### Boss - Worms

- Go directly to the far right worm, if your ATB is full, attack him.
- Focus the far right and the middle worm
- When one worms dies, focus on the middle one until there's only 2 worms left (175 HP)
- Then, kill the two remaining worms at the **same time**.
- They usually need 4 shots each before trying to attack them at the same time
  
    It's really difficult to kill them at the same time since you cannot manipulate the way they appear and there's a slight chance they appear in such a way that you can't hit them at the same time. But don't focus only on one worm if it's the case because the larger worm will appear and deal ridiculous amount of damage. Lower the HP to the 2 remaining worm so the last one will go down in two shots.

### Boss - Eve 3 (320 HP)
- If you have a lot of HP, tank the damages et shoot close to hear to trigger critical hits.
